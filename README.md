Check out some of the low level hooks or animation used in this project.

I use C++ and Win32 APIs to create a little prank. It starts up a dancing troll figure with text "Matt Sux" that follows the cursor around. It blocks any clicks or typing, and the only way to get out is to admit defeat (hint: type out "mattsux" or... restart). 

p.s. Just kidding, Matt! <3
