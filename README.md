I use C++ and Win32 APIs to create a little prank. It starts up a dancing troll figure with text "Matt Sux" that follows the cursor around. It blocks any clicks or typing, and the only way to get out is to admit defeat (hint: type out "mattsux" or... logoff/restart).

p.s. Just kidding, Matt! <3

[update] Changed frames and project settings so that it's no longer about Matt and can be used for other reasons, haha.
